        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>
          I graduated with a Master degree of Computer Science at the University
          of Queensland in Dec 2019.
        </p>
        <p>
          I had 7 months of intern experience working as a Big Data Operation
          and Maintenance Engineer. My role was maintaining the Hadoop Platform
          and writing scripts for data cleaning. After that I became a Java
          developer and involved into a Java Web Design program. My role for
          this position is building Hibernate framework and develop the
          front-end webpages.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm an adaptable person and want to work as a programmer/developer.
          Iâ€™m good at Java and familiar with Python and have a good
          understanding of OOP and AWS as well. I am familiar with the entire
          process of Java Web development includes the front end (HTML5 / CSS),
          backend, JavaScript, SSH framework, and database (MySql / NoSql).
        </p>
        <p>
          For the next two years, I have a visa to legally reside in Australia
          and work for an unlimited period of time.
